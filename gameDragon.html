			Title: Dragon!<br>
			Genre: Game<br>
			Work by: Yanmin Zhou<br>
			Date: Oct 27, 2022<br>
			Software: p5.js, Edge
			</p>
			<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/ZYM/sketches/KH4NtSeaq">Mouse Control</a>

			<p class="textPara">(This is a short project when I started coding.) <br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">This is the first game I completed. It is made with only p5.js with no external library. It is a pixel game inspired by old archade games. I spent around 2 weeks on this project. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">The assets used in this project are collected from the internet (all assets are referred in the code). The game is fully functional on the p5.js online editor. Links for both mouse control version and the keyboard control version are listed on the left. Feel free to check the code. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">I made this project for Creative Coding course at New York University. The idea of making a game like this comes from The Hobbits. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">Since no external libraries are used in this project, I built a collision detection system and a animation system from scratch. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">I had to reduce the elements in the game due to limited time. In the final version, the dragon would land and destroy a building. When all 5 buildings are destroyed, game is over. In the original design, each building has a function and grants you a different ability. The abilities will be disabled when the related building is destroyed.  <br>
