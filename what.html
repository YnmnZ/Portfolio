			<p class="reviewText">Welcome to this unnamed worldbuilding project. I am writing this setting as something I can use for future writing or game development. The idea started during my high school, and became more established after I entered NYU. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="reviewText">I am a fan of the game Cyberpunk 2077. I also consider myself a history enthusiast, specifically interested in mythology. As a passion project, I want to combine mythology with cyberpunk setting. I hope this project can lead to some interesting stories and new interpretation of mythological characters. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="reviewText">The simplified version of the setting has been used for an installation prototype, while I continue to expand on the orginal version. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="reviewText">Inspired by Japanese ACG culture, this project would focus on both character designs and stories, and would include super powers. I do not expect the setting to be scientifically accurate.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="reviewText">Based on what I have in mind right now, I would expect to see this project eventually turn into a free mobile game due to the numerous characters I can design based on different mythologies. Yet it has unlimited potential and can result in a novel or a singleplayer open-world RPG. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="reviewText">I am currently working on a personal wiki site for this project, using Campfire. When the site is more established, the link will be uploaded to this site as well. <br>
