			Work by: Yanmin Zhou<br>
			Date: Jan 28, 2023<br>

			<p class="textPara">This is a collection of 16bit pixel sprites based on elements from the game Apex Legends. Some of the sprites are animated. This collection was originally made for a friend of mine who creates Apex Legends contents. The sprites were originally used to create transitions.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">This is the first animated pixel project I ever created. The reason I chose Apex Legends as the reference is that the game has some already established character designs with different color palettes that I can refer to. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">An animated gif is provided. The speed is reduced to show details of the pixel art. A sprite sheet is also shown on the page. For transparent sprite sheet, please contact me. <br>
