			<p class="textPara">This is a collection of Apex Legends fanart. I would consider this collection as an exploration of my style, and also a drawing practice. The style is inspired by a Japanese anime named "Panties and Stockings with Garterbelt". <br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">The project started as a passion project. It consists of both static drawings and simple animations. This is a record of my self-learning process in the field of drawing. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">The reason I chose the topic is that Apex Legends has a huge diversity of character designs that may challenge me. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="textPara">The original work was made on iPad with Procreate. Some works have been redone with Krita on PC.<br>
